Docker is a containerization platform that allows applications to run in isolated
environments called containers.

Docker Compose is used to define and run multi-container applications using a
YAML configuration file.

Kubernetes is an orchestration system that automates deployment, scaling,
and management of containerized applications.

Persistent volumes are used in Kubernetes to ensure data survives pod restarts.
